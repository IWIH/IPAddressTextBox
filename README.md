# IPv4AddressTextBox
IPv4 Address TextBox for .NET Framework, nothing more!
I tried to cover all transitions and character validation, please, if there is any thing to be covered, let me know.

# Implementation
You do not need any thing special, just add the assembly (dll) to your project's references, and you should find the control in the Toolbox of Visual Studio

# Compatibility
.NET Framework >= 2.0
